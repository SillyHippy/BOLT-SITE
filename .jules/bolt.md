## 2025-05-18 - Client Component Dynamic Import Pattern
**Learning:** Found that heavy, interactive client-side components like `ChatWidget` and `StaticSiteOptimizer` were being imported directly in the root layout, including their code in the initial bundle.
**Action:** Use `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` to lazy load client-only components in `app/layout.tsx`. This decreases initial bundle size and speeds up hydration.
