## FOUNDER STORY
Just Legal Solutions was founded by Joseph Iannazzi after experiencing firsthand how the legal system fails people. Following a workplace injury that required 5 surgeries and years of legal battles, Joseph understood the frustration of delays and being treated like a case number. He built Just Legal Solutions to be different - prioritizing speed, transparency, and treating every client like a human being.

Core Philosophy: "People should help people. Behind every document is a human being trying to make ends meet."

Joseph also works part-time helping people with disabilities find employment, reflecting his commitment to community service.
