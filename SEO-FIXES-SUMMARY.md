# SEO Fixes Implementation Summary

## Fixed SEO Issues from Live Site Report

### ✅ 1. Pricing Consistency (Homepage vs Schema Files)
**Problem:** Homepage showed $30-$200 range, but schema files had outdated $40-$150 pricing
**Solution:** Updated all schema files to consistently use $30 starting prices

**Files Updated:**
- `components/ServiceSchema.tsx` - Updated pricing from fixed amounts to $30 starting prices
- `components/ui/service-schema.tsx` - Fixed default priceRange to "$30-$200"
- `components/ClickOptimization.tsx` - Changed from fixed prices to price ranges starting at $30
- `app/(main)/pricing/metadata.ts` - Updated to reflect $30 starting prices

### ✅ 2. Review Count Consistency 
**Problem:** Some schema files showed 47 reviews while others showed 127
**Solution:** Standardized all review counts to 127 across all schema files

**Files Updated:**
- `scripts/geo-schema-enhancement.ps1` - Updated aggregateRating reviewCount from 47 to 127

### ✅ 3. Operating Hours Consistency
**Problem:** Some files showed business hours (8am-5pm) instead of 24/7 availability
**Solution:** Updated all schema files to show 24/7 operation every day

**Files Updated:**
- `scripts/geo-schema-enhancement.ps1` - Updated to 24/7 every day (not just weekends)
- `components/ui/local-business-schema.tsx` - Changed from business hours to 24/7
- `scripts/schema-markup-domination.js` - Updated to 24/7 operation

### ✅ 4. Simplified Pricing Descriptions
**Problem:** Verbose pricing descriptions with complex discount language
**Solution:** Simplified all descriptions to cleaner format: "Starting at $30"

**Example Changes:**
- Before: Complex discount descriptions
- After: "Professional process serving rates in Tulsa County, Broken Arrow, Sapulpa. Starting $30."

### ✅ 5. Fixed Next.js Build Warnings
**Problem:** Payment page used `<img>` tags causing Next.js optimization warnings
**Solution:** Converted all img tags to Next.js `<Image>` components

**Files Updated:**
- `app/(main)/payments/page.tsx` - Imported Next.js Image component and converted all img tags
