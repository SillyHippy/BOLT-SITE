            <CardTitle>What is a Process Server?</CardTitle>
          </CardHeader>
          <CardContent>
            <p>A process server is a licensed professional responsible for delivering legal documents to individuals involved in court cases. Proper service of process is a constitutional requirement that ensures the defendant&apos;s officially notified of the legal action against them, giving them the opportunity to respond. In Oklahoma, these professionals must be licensed, bonded, and adhere to strict legal standards.</p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 my-4">
                  <li><strong>Licensing is Mandatory:</strong> All private process servers in Oklahoma must be licensed, be at least 18 years old, and have no felony convictions.</li>
                  <li><strong>Ethical Conduct:</strong> It is illegal for a process server to impersonate a law enforcement officer.</li>
                  <li><strong>Alternative Service:</strong> If a person avoids service, Oklahoma law allows for alternative methods with court permission.</li>
                  <li><strong>Fines & Penalties:</strong> Fines for improper service can be as high as $1,000 to ensure compliance.</li>
