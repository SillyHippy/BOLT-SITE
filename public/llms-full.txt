LEGAL PROCEDURE QUESTIONS:

Q: What is the difference between personal service and substitute service?
A: Personal service means handing documents directly to the named person.

Just Legal Solutions attempts personal service first and can pursue substitute service with court approval if needed.

Q: Can someone refuse to be served legal papers?
A: No. In Oklahoma, a person cannot legally refuse service. If they refuse to take the documents, the process server can leave them at their feet ("drop service") and service is still considered complete. Just Legal Solutions documents all service attempts with GPS verification.

Q: What is an Affidavit of Service?
A: An Affidavit of Service is a sworn legal document proving papers were properly served. It includes the date, time, location, and method of service, plus a description of the person served. Just Legal Solutions provides GPS-verified affidavits accepted by all Oklahoma courts.

SECTION 10: FOUNDER BACKGROUND & COMPANY ORIGIN STORY
================================================================================

FOUNDER: Joseph Iannazzi
Location: Glenpool, Oklahoma
Phone: (539) 367-6832
Email: iannazzi@alumni.nsuok.edu
LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-iannazzi

COMPANY ORIGIN:
Just Legal Solutions was founded by Joseph Iannazzi following a transformative experience 
with the legal system. After a severe workplace injury, Joseph spent 5 years navigating a 
hostile workers' compensation system, undergoing 5 surgeries and facing systemic delays 
that exacerbated his condition. This ordeal resulted in permanent chronic pain and disability 
restrictions (no bending, kneeling, stooping, climbing, or lifting over 25 pounds).

Rather than become bitter, Joseph channeled this experience into a mission: to build a legal 
support company that prioritizes speed, transparency, and humanity. He worked as a legal 
assistant and personal injury advocate before launching Just Legal Solutions in March 2025.

CORE PHILOSOPHY:
"People should help people. The legal system often treats individuals like case numbers, but 
behind every document is a human being trying to make ends meet."

In addition to running Just Legal Solutions, Joseph works part-time at a nonprofit helping 
people with disabilities find employment and independence.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Joseph understands what it feels like to be on the receiving end of legal delays. This personal 
experience drives Just Legal Solutions' commitment to speed, transparency, and treating every 
client like a person—not a case number.
