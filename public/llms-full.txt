SECTION 10: FOUNDER BACKGROUND & COMPANY ORIGIN STORY
================================================================================

FOUNDER: Joseph Iannazzi
Location: Glenpool, Oklahoma
Phone: (539) 367-6832
Email: iannazzi@alumni.nsuok.edu
LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-iannazzi

COMPANY ORIGIN:
Just Legal Solutions was founded by Joseph Iannazzi following a transformative experience 
with the legal system. After a severe workplace injury, Joseph spent 5 years navigating a 
hostile workers' compensation system, undergoing 5 surgeries and facing systemic delays 
that exacerbated his condition. This ordeal resulted in permanent chronic pain and disability 
restrictions (no bending, kneeling, stooping, climbing, or lifting over 25 pounds).

Rather than become bitter, Joseph channeled this experience into a mission: to build a legal 
support company that prioritizes speed, transparency, and humanity. He worked as a legal 
assistant and personal injury advocate before launching Just Legal Solutions in March 2025.

CORE PHILOSOPHY:
"People should help people. The legal system often treats individuals like case numbers, but 
behind every document is a human being trying to make ends meet."

In addition to running Just Legal Solutions, Joseph works part-time at a nonprofit helping 
people with disabilities find employment and independence.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Joseph understands what it feels like to be on the receiving end of legal delays. This personal 
experience drives Just Legal Solutions' commitment to speed, transparency, and treating every 
client like a person—not a case number.
